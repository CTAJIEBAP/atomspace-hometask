Steps:
1. Download and build opencog, you will need at least two libraries:
   - cogutil - http://github.com/opencog/cogutil
   - atomspace - https://github.com/opencog/atomspace
2. Read about opencog Atoms and pattern matching, some useful links:
   - https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Hands_On_With_OpenCog#Atoms
   - https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Manipulating_Atoms_in_C%2B%2B
   - https://wiki.opencog.org/w/SatisfactionLink_and_BindLink
   - https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/blob/master/opencog/query/README.md
3. Build and run query.cpp
   - you can use cmake to build it similarily to opencog
4. Answer questions below

Questions:
1. What does "query.cpp" do?
2. Does it work correctly? Explain your answer.
3. Does its execution time depend on input data length linearly?
   (Please modify the program and make some experiments.)
   What time do you have for 256 bounding boxes, 512, 1024?
   Does it take too long to search in 16384 bounding boxes?
4. Using code inspection and debugger investigate why time is not linear?
   (look in code at https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/tree/master/opencog/query)
5. Is it possible to fix time and query issues by changing
   input data and query structure?
6. Try to fix issue by overriding methods in PatternMatchCallback.
